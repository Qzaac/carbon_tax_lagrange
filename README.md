# Setting a carbon tax using Lagrange's duality

This repo is a uni project led by Prof. Olivier Fercoq and a team of 4 students. We built a dataset of products (price and carbon footprint) and agents (utility functions)
and then used CVXPY to compute the dual function and maximize it. We also provide an economical interpretation (in french), see [the final report](Rapport_groupe2_PAF.pdf).
